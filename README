# School of fish N-body simulation in C
    This project builds upon the work of Couzin, Iain D., et al. "Collective memory and spatial sorting in animal groups.". It represents a self-organizing model of group formation in two-dimensional space, and use it to investigate the spatial dynamics of animal groups such as fish schools.
